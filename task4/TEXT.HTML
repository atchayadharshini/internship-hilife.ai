      <p class= "bg-white text-dark"   type="disc"> Fashion design is the art of applying design, aesthetics, clothing construction and natural beauty to clothing and its accessories.<br>
      It is influenced by culture and different trends, and has varied over time and place.......<br>
      Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team.<br>
      Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers.<br>
      Most fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed..<br>
      While others are self-employed and design for individual clients</p>

      <p  class= "bg-white"> "A fashion designer creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers...<br>
       He or she can specialize in clothing, accessory, or jewelry design, or may work in more than one of these areas."...<br>
       Fashion designers work in different ways.<br>
       Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form, another term for mannequin.<br>
       Some designers work along with certain apps that can help connect all ideas together and expand their thoughts on a design</p>

      <h3>design3</h3>        
      <p  class= "bg-white text-dark">Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing..<br>
       They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, and they work within a wide range of materials, colors, patterns and styles...<br>
      Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. <br> 
      Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive</p>
