        <p class="two">A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content<br>
             that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.<br>
            Examples of notable websites are Google,<br>
             Amazon,<br>
             Wikipedia.<br>
             
             All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.<br>
             There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network,<br>
             such as a company's internal website for its employees.<br>
             Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose,<br>
             such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social networking.<br>
             Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site,<br>
             which often starts with a home page.
